# neural_net_dart
This is my first time trying neural networks ( in any programming languages ).

I choosed dart as programming language, because I work with it at my job, and I'm very interested in it's features. It also resembles me of C++, which I like a lot.

The main idea here is to create a very simple neural network to fit a 'squigle' on binary ( 0 and 1 ) points in a graphic. It will implements RELu activation functions, and it is very small, and not optimal at all : )

The input is a stream of points. The dimensions in which they are taken from are: [Is effetctive?] by [The dosage].

The idea for the problem comes from statquest free youtube introduction for NN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw&list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1&index=2

And this code will use https://github.com/enesdemirag/neuraldart/tree/master as a guide sometimes ( since I have no idea of what I'm doing ).
